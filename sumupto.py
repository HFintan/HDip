# Problem 1
# sum of all integers from 0 to user-input n

# Default true starts while loop, which prompts user for suitable input
while True:

        your_choice = int(input("Please enter a positive integer:"))
    except ValueError:

        print("Try again. We're looking for a whole number greater than zero.")
        continue
    # if input an integer but negative, returns user to prompt
    if your_choice <0:
        print("Almost there! We're looking for a whole number GREATER than zero.")

# Fomula uses fewer operations than adding up all the numbers.
print(your_choice*(your_choice+1)/2)
